# Words Racer by Sebastian Pulak

## Play the game

The game is available at https://sebastianpulak.github.io/words-racer/ \
Main goal of the game is to measure your typing speed. In the future I'm hoping to add ability to compete against your friends in real time but for now it's only a single player.

## How to run locally

1. Clone this repository using a command in terminal `git clone https://github.com/sebastianpulak/words-racer.git`
2. Navigate to the project `cd words-racer`
3. Install npm pacakges using `npm install`
4. Start development server using `ng serve --open` - it should open in your default browser at the address `http://localhost:4200/`

## TODO: 

- About page,
- Ranking view (locally for now, maybe add firebase in the future with rooms to play together)
