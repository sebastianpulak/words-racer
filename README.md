# Words Racer by Sebastian Pulak

## Play the game

The game is available at https://sebastianpulak.github.io/words-racer/ \
Main goal of the game is to measure your typing speed. In the future I'm hoping to add ability to compete against your friends in real time but for now it's only a single player.

## How to run locally

1. Clone this repository using a command in terminal `git clone https://github.com/sebastianpulak/words-racer.git`
2. Navigate to the project `cd words-racer`
3. Install npm pacakges using `npm install`
4. Start development server using `ng serve --open` - it should open in your default browser at the address `http://localhost:4200/`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
